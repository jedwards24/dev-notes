## Functions to Add

* DF comparison

Could I have a package of functions very early exploration/cleaning of a df (preclean??) 

To edwards:

* numeric summary
* test transforms
* group missing?
* format_numeric()
* str_total()?
* key checking
* column simplify checks
* binomial smooth
* qboxplot?
* Cut midpoint and width cut
* datetime validity checking
* factor_to_logical()?...probably not needed - as.logical() seems ok for T/F factors. Not for 0/1 though.
* na_if_any() - replace multiple values with NA.
* summary of df vars that have limited use: all NA, one value, NA + one value, value == zero. Add na.strings arg.

jemodel:

* impute by group?
* glmnet summaries
* Many others (rough)

jemisc

* column ordering (dates first, then generalise?)
